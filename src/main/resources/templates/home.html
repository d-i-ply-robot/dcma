        <p>

                AkrosProgramme is an automated tool that performs a comprehensive analysis of software programs. It evaluates the structure and organization of the code to identify potential issues and provide recommendations for improvement. By analyzing the program's architecture, logic, and design patterns, AkrosProgramme helps developers identify and address structural weaknesses that could impact the program's performance, maintainability, and reliability. With its objective reporting and actionable insights, AkrosProgramme empowers developers to enhance the robustness and quality of their software projects.

        <p> Akros uses the DCMA 14-point checklist to assess the quality of construction programs.
